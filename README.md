# Siren Audio Generative & Feedback applications for Mac/Win

Dear Internet Traveller,

Many moons ago I made a couple of audio software applications that I distributed commercially.

I used a third party copy protection system that did things like ask users for a new password when they plugged a new monitor in.

We all make mistakes.

Anyway, the software is here, free for you to use and redistribute, though thou shalt not make any cash selling it.

It may or may not work, and is provided as is. I take no responsibility for anything negative that comes from you running these apps.

Cheers,

Mike (Siren Audio creator)
